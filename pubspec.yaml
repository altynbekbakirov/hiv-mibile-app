# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/
     - assets/images/symptoms/
     - assets/images/moods/
     - assets/languages/
     - assets/images/icons/Add/
     - assets/images/icons/School/
     - assets/images/icons/Diary/
     - assets/images/icons/Main/
     - assets/images/icons/Map/
     - assets/images/icons/Notification/Active/
     - assets/images/icons/Notification/Regular/

     - assets/images/tabs/
     - assets/images/prophylaxis/3/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
     - family: NunitoSans
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/NunitoSans-Light.ttf
           weight: 300
         - asset: assets/fonts/NunitoSans-Regular.ttf
           weight: 400
         - asset: assets/fonts/NunitoSans-SemiBold.ttf
           weight: 500
         - asset: assets/fonts/NunitoSans-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
     - family: CustomIcons
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/CustomIcons.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
